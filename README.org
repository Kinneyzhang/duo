* Introduction

Duo is a library of in place list operations in Emacs-Lisp. The
functions use references whenever possible.

A =duo= is a =cons= used to reference elements in lists.

Caution : apply these functions to circular lists
would produce infinite loops.

However, some functions, like *-circ-* or *-rotate-*, simulate
circular lists by :

  - continuing at the beginning once arrived at the end

  - continuing at the end once arrived at the beginning
